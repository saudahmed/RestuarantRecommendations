# RestuarantRecommendations

This is part of a big project that I am currently working on. This RestuarantRecommendations is scaled down to show relevant iOS code
and what we are doing inside the application. This project was started on Gitlab and has recently been mirrored to Github to track changes. Recruiters and technical
leads can go through the code written in Swift 4..

# Purpose
Add a recommended restuarant to your list to store. Check the details of the restuarant later like phone number and location. Ability to rate
restuarant and share the restuarant details with other people. Receive timed user notifications with in background. User notifications are only there
to show the notification functionality. Notification contains detail of the restuarant randomly picked from the stored data.
